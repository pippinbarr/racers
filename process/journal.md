## Spinning up the racing wheels (2025-07-21)

I'm back in Montr√©al after a pretty extensive vacation (though some of the vacation was at DiGRA so not totally vacation). In the last 10 days we were in London at Tina and Iqbal's place and on a Saturday I found myself wanting to do some "game design". So I came up with an idea of a 1D of Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment (which I'll deal with elsewhere), but also the idea of a variations game based on my imagined platonic ideal of a three-lane racer game.

I ended up putting together 71 variation ideas as above, over the course of five days. A bunch of them are quite fine and I find myself hoping to put together 50 of them to actually make and release. This is all intimately connected with the fact I'm trying to write a book about variation games, so I want to be making one at the same time, and here we are.

I did go looking for an Ur-example of this kind of game and promptly couldn't find one. Strangely this Mattel racing handheld is the closest to what I sort of imagined functionally if not visually:

I also looked at some Atari games, of which *Grand Prix* and *Street Racer* had some of what I was looking for.

It remains a teeny bit unclear how I want to implement the underlying game, but I don't think any/many of the games totally rely on my knowing that ahead of time - and if anything the specifics of the implementation may well *help* in generating other ideas/niceties within the current ideas. The fact *Street Racer* has continuous movement is interesting/surprising to me as I imagined these games involving teleporting between lanes... and maybe I'll keep that in my one, I don't know. I don't think it's *that* important to have a really strong historical referent anyway.

Next tasks would be:

- Write up the variations
- Start prototyping the base case
