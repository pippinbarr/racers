# To-dos

## Design

- ~~Do not forget to review the #interesting tag in the [ists](./ists.md) document~~

## UI thinking

- **Did do this** ~~Should I pop definitions in somewhere, maybe after you select a level you see a definition, and then the game? Some of the ists are pretty confusing and I don't think it's all that interesting in this case to say the game defines them?~~

## Testing

- ~~Play them all and note down issues/changes~~
- ~~Read through all texts~~
    - ~~Copyist bad outro~~
    - ~~Demist no outro~~
    - ~~Gist needs no-apple outro (e.g. you don't get the gist?)~~
    - ~~Typist should end on "REDRUM"~~
- ~~Send to J+M when done~~

## Release

- ~~Main page~~
- ~~Press kit~~
- ~~Journal entry~~
- ~~Testing mobile~~
- ~~Testing (just reading the texts etc.)~~
- ~~Website~~
- ~~Reddit, that discord, Bluesky~~
- ~~Contact Press~~

- Closing statement

## General

- Question of points - does every one need it? e.g. Onanist?

## Definition

- ~~Add menu button/keys if needed~~

## Alarmist

- ~~Carefuls if you're ever next to the wall as well~~

## Checklist

- **Yeah that seems bad somehow** ~~Add "flirt with death"? (i.e. get within one tile of a wall or yourself?) Maybe a bit overwrought~~
- ~~Add "get moving"~~

## Nudist

- ~~Implement skin shedding version~~

## Obstructionist

- ~~Errors after quit (presumably a timer, presumably a setTimeout instead of a Phaser.Timer)~~

## Persist

- ~~Some weirdness around restarting... feels like persist shouldn't be able to be restarted/menu'ed once it's there (should remove its ability and the indicator it can)~~

## Twist

- **Rotating the camera feels like a bit of a... game changer?** ~~Feels underwhelming... could we rotate more stuff? Groups around their centre? The canvas?~~
- ~~Rotate back to normal on die?~~

## Typist

- ~~Double-eat on space apple is a problem~~
- ~~Need to check if score still being affected by carriage return (think not)~~
- I did. Let's see. ~~Clear the text for the game over? Maybe not?~~

## Bugs

- ~~Something weird happens to controls text over time "ARROWS CONTROL SNAKE SNAKE SNAKE" some kind of additive issue~~
- **Struggling to reproduce right now?** ~~Apple randoms around instead of being stable in Deist~~
- ~~Alarmist doesn't show gameover text and doesn't reset camera on death and doesn't have controls text visible (sounds pretty interrelated)~~
- **Just moved away from Hammer.** ~~On mobile swipes progressively trigger more often???~~
- ~~Conformist straight up broken... or rather lets me go off the right edge?~~
- **Fixed...? But... how can it be?** ~~Apple positioning still insane in Deist... why?~~
- **Sped it up and also set arousal higher after hideControls so the snake starts out a bit horny** ~~Onanist feels a little slow~~
- **Think it's okay** ~~Not 100% copies are actually dying when they should~~
- ~~Saw that bug with this and controls (repeating)~~
- **I cared. It was largely that the snakeHead wasn't having its origin set and added snake bits weren't either.** ~~Don't know how much I care but when twist unrotates things aren't aligned normally?~~
