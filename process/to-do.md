# To-dos

## Racer (base game)

### System
- ~~Add crashing~~
- Stupidest version of this is in place (as in, adding enough opponent cars to take up all but one lane, without any thought for impossible scenarios yet) ~~Add algorithm for generating opponent cars (think about impossible scenarios)~~
- ~~Add speed-up over time~~
- ~~Add accumulating score (may be placeholder but maybe not)~~

- Revisit opponent placement and speed relationship (should I limit all opponents to the same speed to avoid impossible scenarios?)
- Try more than lanes-1 opponents, but making sure to assign them always to at most n-1 of the n lanes? (How to track where the assignments are?)
- Try fast-tweened lane changing (and interrupts? maybe not)

### Graphics
- ~~Add different colours for opponents for visual wonderment~~

### Sound
- ~~Player engine (some ongoing buzzing)~~
- Dicked around with this enough for now. It ain't perfect that's for fucking sure. ~~Opponent engine(s) (doppler buzzing? pitch shifting? looks like it's possible!)~~
- ~~Add crashing sound~~
    
### Input
- Touch input (swipes for lane changes first up)
