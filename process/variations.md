# Variations

Well, we need an official list and musing on how they would work right? For now I'll suck in the ones from the notebook that seem immediately fun to do, so this is a curation pass. 

## Racer

This is the default. It's still a bit under construction but is essentially a three-lane racer with opponents coming down the screen (because you're faster than them technically) and you have to avoid them with a time-based scoring system.

(Question: do I want lane changes to be tweened? I should try it out. Even a very fast tween might look nice. What about changing lanes mid-tween - get it? Changing horses mid stream? You don't. I mean you don't do it.)

## Gridlock

Just fill the entire field with cars that don't move. The player is in there in the usual place but if they move left or right they die (kind of weird to move while stopped? But maybe it's funny to have that little agency?)

## Two hour commute

The standard game with a clock counting down the distance. A building on screen somewhere, and a house at the end. Very Desert Bus I suppose. A little animation of a little person getting into the car from the building? An intertistial/"cut-scene"... maybe that's funnier in a weird way? And then it just cuts to the exact usual game... kind of like that.

## One lane road

There's only one lane. Unclear how to handle opponents in this case? I guess they could drift back and match your speed and drift back up again? Just for visual interest? Or just one person in front of you really drifting back and forth but never actually hitting you. No steering involved (can you crash into the side?)

## Low speed chase(r)

Three police cars across the lanes behind you (or six?) and just open road in front of you. Do you eventually run out of gas? It counts down and eventually the whole thing just stops and you get arrested.

The more there are these endings (see two hour commute) the more I'll need a consistent design approach to them. Cut scenes versus texts versus in-game results. I do quite like the idea of really low resolution animations as I haven't done anything like that for ages? Even just like a two frame bouncing thing?

## Drag racer

You'd need a specific input to "go" which could be "up" (swipe up) so that would work (opens up questions about changing speed in general? Which... I just don't know how I feel about it tbh). But anyway you need to hit "go" at the right moment and that's it you either win or you don't... or maybe it's worse than that and there's just a huge chance element? 

Parachute comes out, someone is declared a winner. Parachute could be in the ending animation if I'm going all in on that. I can sense it becoming part of the vision.

## Track and race

Repeatedly hit "up" to keep your speed up? Otherwise you grind to a halt? What about the problem of the cars behind you? Maybe they zip past you but never into your butt unless you change lanes in front of them at a low speed? Maybe they're ... well it sounds complex, but kind of fun.

## Piano roll

No cars? Just pickups in the three lanes that play a song. We might want eight lanes for an octave? What's a great one octave song?

## You're going the wrong way

Same game but the cars come pointing at you and fast, you inevitably will crash I suppose?

## Freeway / n-lane racer

Well I've already built the first version of that. Open question on making it single pixel scale though... I think it's worth trying.

## Ghost racer

You're a ghost car, can't crash, har har. Oh and there's the idea you *can* switch lanes to left and right and... see something else, some ghostly world outside the game, that would be really neat right? I quite love it... could come into view in a fun way too... actually especially with tweening... hmmm, this is a better one than I'd thought. Reminders obviously of Ghost Pong but also of Jostle Parent.

I see I wrote "get to heaven" as a potential secret objective... heh.

## High Definition

Sub in "awesome graphics" for everything... is that interesting or just stupid though? I can't quite tell if it's worth it, so I should probably prototype it and see.

## Dating Sim

Sounds too complex to me right now, but the idea is crashing starts a "date" where you have conversational options and can maybe pickup and give gifts and... what? Get married at some point? It's sort of funny but currently seems pretty awkward...

## Racer Problem

Trolley Problem version with a succession of trolley problem situations. Funny if it's continuous driving so you run people over and keep going. Some stuff you wouldn't be able to easily do like the loop track.

## Street Legal

Dumb name but the idea of things like stop signs and crossings so you have to obey the law. This would mandate speed control unless it's automated (which wouldn't be very interesting unless it would)

## Night Racer

Dark except for headlights up the road. In this context they'd need to overlap the other tracks a little so that you can have a chance of changing lanes. I suppose the other cars would also have lights. I wonder if it gets nightmarish or not? Cars driving with their lights off? I dunno. Odd how confused this sounds given the basic clarify of the idea...

## Drunk Racer

Who is impaired, you or the others? Everyone? Controls flip or delay or trigger without you. This is another one where tweening would make it more expressive so I suppose I'm talking myself into that idea aren't I. You could even manipulate the car to drift around and fix it with lane changing.

## Self Racing Car

The whole thing takes care of its self, getting arbitrarily fast like Zorba. Actual "AI" to do this? Only impressive if it never ever crashes? Or funny if it does... hm

## Carpool Karaoke

The same game but just the extra bits to be able to sing as you drive. MIDI plus the words plus the bouncing ball (which implies timing which is scary). Funny if it's *not* a well known song? Funny if it's My Way or some other classic bombastic karaoke song? How to synchronize?
